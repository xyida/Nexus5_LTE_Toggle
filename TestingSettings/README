TestingSettings - basically some productve finger exercise

This program opens the TestingSettings menu of your android device and
quietly quits after. You can do this without this program by
typing *#*#4636#*#* into the dialer. But this works even when you don't
have a dialer.

There are countless other programs out there doing the same. For example
TelInfo (com.aebeinroth.telinfo) but I couldn't find source of it, so
I dug deep and found

Good luck,
